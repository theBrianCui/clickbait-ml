1 45 Amazing Photos Of The Riots In Greece UPDATE: Parliament has passed the austerity measures, paving the way for financial assistance from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund which will hopefully stabilize not just the Greek economy, but the world economy. Unrest continues in the streets of Athens. Demonstrations against the Greek government's proposed austerity measures turned violent in Athens today, with protesters hurling rocks and firebombs at police. Police have responded with tear gas and batons. If parliament doesn't pass the cost-cutting plan, Greece will not receive a bailout package from the European Union. Without the aid package, Greece will default on its debt, sending shock waves through the world economy.

Four people were killed and 46 injured when two female suicide bombers detonated their explosives outside a mobile phone market in the town on January 11, 2015. Although no one claimed responsibility the attacks bore the hallmark of Boko Haram Islamists who have been increasingly using female suicide bombers in their armed campaign to establish a hardline Islamic state. Potiskum, the commercial hub of Yobe state has been repeatedly attacked by Boko Haram.
