1 Seriously, Don't Use Krokodil These photos will turn your stomach. Krokodil is a street version of desomorphine, an opiate that's 3 times more powerful and 10 times cheaper than heroin, and has become an epidemic in Russia. It's so named because regular users develop gangrenous, scaly skin resembling that of a crocodile. Krokodil is made with such toxic chemicals that it rots the flesh and bones of its users. WARNING: Extremely graphic images.

I don't know if you guys have heard about her or not, but she was this woman in Florida... Anyway, a woman in a place that was decidedly not Florida (Oklahoma) named Sammay Blackwell was mistaken for the Orlando-based now free woman who people believe killed her daughter, and was followed and almost run off the road for her crime of doppelgängery. I'm sure this is how guys who rocked Chaplin mustaches in the '30s and '40s felt.
